Software Engineering focuses on programming and software development.

In this CFG Degree web application there is a simple HTML structure with a dropdown menu to select from 4 degree specialisations and a button to submit this choice. When the user selects a specialisation and clicks "Submit" more information on the 4 CFG tracks (software,fullstack,data,product) is displayed below .

The JavaScript code handles the logic to update the specialisation information based on the user's selection using an if-else statement, a data structure (object), and a function for reusability. It uses event listeners to trigger the update: when the user clicks the button the webpage changes.

There are some changes to the HTML and CSS styles applied to make the CFGApp more visually appealing. There is a Timelapse for the specialisations to appear one by one with emojis, as well as there is an animated element to make the numbers of degrees role in the box.

Additionally, there are further events on the webpage. When the user clicks the "Enter Your Name" button, a pop-up will appear asking for their name. After they enter their name and click "Submit", a personalized welcome message appears with a discount displayed in an alert. The pop-up can be closed using the close button (×) in the top right corner.
